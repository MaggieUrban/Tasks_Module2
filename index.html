            Understand<br />
            Your Map & Timing?
          </h2>
          <p>
            To start, print out the hiking guide and map. If it’s raining, throw
            them in a Zip-Lock bag. Read over the guide, study the map, and have
            a good idea of what to expect. I like to know what my next landmark
            is as I hike. For example, I’ll read the guide and know that say, in
            a mile, I make a right turn at the junction.
